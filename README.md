React boilerplate generator
===========================

This generators helps you setup a React project.
It includes as much basic features as possible (routing, i18n, flux, tests, compilation), and a small amount of code to demonstrate how to use them together.

This repo is open-sourced mainly as an inspiration on how to set up a React project, as well as for internal use at [V-Technologies](https://github.com/v-technologies).
Feel free to suggest any improvement, but we do not assure you that they will be integrated, as this boilerplate should continue to fit our own requirements.

Usage
-----

```
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-react-boilerplate-vtech

cd /path/to/your/project
yo react-boilerplate-vtech
```
